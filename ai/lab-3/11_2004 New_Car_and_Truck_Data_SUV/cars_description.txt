NAME:  2004 New Car and Truck Data
TYPE:  Sample
SIZE:  428 observations, 19 variables


DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:
Specifications are given for 428 new vehicles for the 2004 year. The variables recorded include price, measurements 
relating to the size of the vehicle, and fuel efficiency.


VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS:

Columns	Variables
  1- 45	Vehicle Name
 47		Sports Car? (1=yes, 0=no)
 49		Sport Utility Vehicle? (1=yes, 0=no)
 51		Wagon? (1=yes, 0=no)
 53		Minivan? (1=yes, 0=no)
 55		Pickup? (1=yes, 0=no)
 57		All-Wheel Drive? (1=yes, 0=no)
 59		Rear-Wheel Drive? (1=yes, 0=no)
 61- 66	Suggested Retail Price, what the manufacturer thinks the
		vehicle is worth, including adequate profit for the
		automaker and the dealer (U.S. Dollars)
 68- 73	Dealer Cost (or "invoice price"), what the dealership pays
		the manufacturer (U.S. Dollars)
 75- 77	Engine Size (liters)
 79- 80	Number of Cylinders (=-1 if rotary engine)
 82- 84	Horsepower
 86- 87	City Miles Per Gallon
 89- 90	Highway Miles Per Gallon
 92- 95	Weight (Pounds)
 97- 99	Wheel Base (inches)
101-103	Length (inches)
105-106	Width (inches)

RELATED DATASETS:

A similar dataset appeared as one of the sample datasets shipped with the _Student Edition of Execustat_ (PWS-KENT 1990).

Another similar dataset, submitted by Robin Lock, may be found in the _Journal of Statistics Education_ dataset archive at 
http://www.amstat.org/publications/ jse/datasets/93cars.dat. The accompanying article "1993 New Car Data", Journal of 
Statistics Education, vol. 1, no. 1, by Lock (1993) may be found at the site 
http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v1n1/datasets.lock.html.

COMMENTS ON MISSING VALUES:
Length and Width of pickup trucks were not given in _Kiplinger's_. Possible updates to the dataset (viewable on a vehicle 
by vehicle basis) may be found at the site http://www.kiplinger.com/tools/carfinder/; these updates may allow some of the 
missing values to be filled in.

PEDAGOGICAL NOTES:
Suggested Retail Price/Dealer Cost and the two MPG variables are popular choices as 
response variables. One suggested exploration - try fitting the MPG variables as linear in reciprocal weight (clear 
outliers to this strongly linear pattern are the hybrid gas/electric cars). Other explorations are suggested in the 
article of Lock (1993) referenced above.
