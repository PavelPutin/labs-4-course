for example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the program. if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this license. if the distribution and/or use of the program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the program under this license may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. in such case, this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license. the free software foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the general public license from time to time. such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. each version is given a distinguishing version number. if the program specifies a version number of this license which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the free software foundation. if the program does not specify a version number of this license, you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation. if you wish to incorporate parts of the program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. for software which is copyrighted by the free software foundation, write to the free software foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. because the program is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty for the program, to the extent permitted by applicable law. except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/or other parties provide the program "as is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you. should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction
